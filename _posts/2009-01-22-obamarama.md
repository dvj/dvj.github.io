As might be expected, the changing of our president has been a frequent topic of conversation of late. What I find interesting in talking to my friends and colleagues is that many of his most ardent supported are now feeling very uneasy about him taking over the office. Granted, these are the people who care the most about the state of our country in general, and likely feel that they have a lot to lose personally if things dont work out as they dreamed about many moons ago. And while no single golden proclamation will enable us to halt our fall from grace, most everything I've managed to gather since the inauguration has been extremely positive, with little vocal dissent from those who must be surely boiling in their own blood. Here's the list I've put together:

  *  Ordered the closing of Gitmo
  *  Managed to convince his security <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">warriors </span>worriers, to keep his Blackberry
  *  Talked to the heads of Egypt, Israel, Jordan, and the Palistinian Authority
  *  Installed a second backboard in the tennis court so he can have full court basketball games
  *  Instructed all government agencies to follow the Army Handbook on torture, in essence, eliminating waterboarding
  *  Took a leisurely stroll through the White House press room, just to say &#8216;What's up.'
  *  Ordered the closing of all CIA secret prisons
  *  Inducted Hillary into the post of SoS with a speech at the State Dept
  *  Froze the salaries of highly compensated White House aides (symbolic, but apropos)
  *  Issued a memo on the Freedom of Information Act, stating info should be free unless it can't be, not the other way around
  *  Mandated a 5 day grace period for public comment (on the newly redesigned <a href="http://whitehouse.gov/" target="_blank">whitehouse.gov</a>) before any law is signed into effect

Now, there are definitely some missing items on there, like  &#8220;Iraq&#8221; and &#8220;Economic Recovery Plan&#8221; for starters but I guess I can give the guy his first full week.

I didn't realize it was Memorial Day weekend until sometime on Friday afternoon, so I didn't get any big plans together, but still managed to get a pretty awesome day trip in.

On Sunday, I headed down to Pinnacles National Monument with Brendan. Because of emergency garden tending in the morning, we didn't get out of the house until about noon. It took about 2 and a half hours to get there, in surprisingly light holiday traffic. We found out at the visitor center that the major attraction, the Bear Gulch Bat Cave was closed temporarily, but undeterred we headed out to the Bear Gulch trail and planned to do the High Peaks Loop -- about 9 miles with 1500' vertical.

The trail was different than others I have done in Northern California. It was like Joshua Tree, except with bigger mountains, and lots more vegetation. There were actually three distinct parts to the trail. The first had many big boulders all over, with various flowers and plants interspersed, with lots of moss on the North face of the rocks. The second part opened up into fields of grasses and oaks, even high up on the ridge. Finally, the low part was a pretty typical deciduous forest, with squirrels in the trees and frogs in the streams. Brendan was trying out a new pair of trail shoes, so we trail-ran most of the down hill, and some of the uphill before collapsing. 

All-in-all, quite a nice day-trip. A++ would visit again. Especially if the bat caves are open.

A couple weekends ago I competed in the Shinteki Decathlon 5, with Mark, Paul and Jesse. Shinteki is sort of a puzzle heavy scavenger hunt. We rode all around Santa Clara County, solving clues on life-size Monopoly boards, with roosters and banjos in the the background, on busy sidewalks while quoting Shakespeare with confused onlookers, and especially in the car while in between all the locations. We finished middle of the pack, which was right about where I thought we would be, considering it was the first time for everyone involved. It was a very fun event, well worth the $100 a head entry.

So, I bought a mac a couple days ago. For being such a computer geek, I really have no practical experience using a mac. The last time I sat down at one for more than 30 seconds was in 4th grade, using a ][ GS. The degree to which everything not only works, but how it works together, is impressive. It also show how many nice, little things I take for granted on Linux. My gripes with OS X so far would be:

 - No 'focus follows mouse.' I've been using this for years now, on both linux and windows, and it's a hard habit to break
 - Minimized windows cant be brought back with a keyboard command. Since screen space is limited on the laptop's small screen, I end up minimizing things to make room. Having to mouse over to the dock, find them, then click to restore? Ugh.

There's a few minor things (too many modifier keys and not enough mouse buttons), but so far so good.

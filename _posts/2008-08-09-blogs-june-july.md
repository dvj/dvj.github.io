Looks like I missed June and July, and I've sorta figured out why. Blogs aren't useful if either: a) absolutely nothing interesting is happening, because then you just don't have anything to write about, or b) when super-awesome things are happening, because you just don't have any time to write about them. It seems my life consists mostly of those two cases. I guess during the 'a' cases I need to remember the last 'b' case and write about it. Something to work on.

Anyway, fun stuff did happen the last two months. June got off to a good start with an trip up to the Lost Coast. This was more or less a off-roading trip in Brendan's XTerra and Ian's bike. Beer, hibachi, steak, and beautiful surroundings. What more could you want?

I also finally got around to doing the Zion Subway trip I've been trying to plan for 3 years. It was quite spectacular: repelling down obstacles on the canyon floor in and out of pools of intensely cold water surrounded by walls several hundred feet high. Finding dinosaur tracks embedded in the stone, and observing the natural convex canyon walls dug out by the force of the flowing water. The rest of Zion park is also amazing.

This was really my first trip to the American Southwest, and I was blown away by the grandeur of the wonderfully colored canyon walls stretching high above the Narrows. Lee and I continued through Utah and Colorado stopping in at Bryce Canyon, Arches, Moab, a petrified forest, Fisher Towers, Vail, and finally into Denver. Unfortunately, I got seriously ill after leaving Zion, and finally went to the ER in Denver to be treated for my mystery gastrointestinal bug. They gave me some appetite++ medicine, which combined with a couple bags of Saline and the comfiness of Ben and Micelle's couch had me back in shape to head down to Mike and Suzanne's wedding-thing.

A went up to Tahoe for the 4th of July weekend with Kat and Elio. The smoke from all the forest fires in CA seemed to congregate right over the lake, rendering the normally gorgeous view all but impossible to make out. At some points you couldn't even see the lake from the road. Still a fun-filled trip though!

The next weekend I did Half Dome for the first time. I was expecting it to be a grueling death-march up to a crowded climb along the cables to the top, but much to my surprise, the trek up to the end was amazing. No one ever told me that there were super impressive waterfalls along the way. Totally makes the trail worth it. The end was indeed crowded, even through we left our campsite just outside the park at 4:30am. Going up the outside of the steel safety cables is definitely the way to go.

A couple weekends later a whole gang of us went Kayaking and Canoeing on the Russian River up in Marin. I nice, relaxing time out in the sun, floating lazily downstream.

The big storm that came though San Francisco and dumped in Tahoe last week made perfect conditions to head up into the mountains; so I did just that last Saturday. I decided I'd try cross country skiing, envisioning myself gleefully sliding across groomed tracks with pristine wilderness on either side, birds chirping and scurring about in the pines, breaking the sweet silence of the forest. 

What my vision lacked, however, was hills &#8211; specifically the uphill part. I do believe I have a new appreciation of ski lifts, and my thighs are still reminding me of my newfound respect three days later. 

It took me a few hours to get the hang of the xc gear, as the skiis, boots, and binding are completely different from their downhill counterparts. Cross country is more a combination of ice skating and telemark skiing than anything related to downhill. Before taking my noon-time lesson, I attempted to propel myself with about 90% arm-strength, which left my upperbody exhausted after one lap around the kiddie run. I learned shortly thereafter that kicking your legs is really the key &#8211; to initiate the gliding motion which (in theory) makes the skiis more useful than walking. I couldn't quite get the hang of uphills though. I mostly resorted to walking up in my reverse snowplow orientation as the seasoned skiiers flew by me, seemingly ignoring gravity, friction, and bio-mechanical limits. 

I was right about the scenery. Once away from the main lodge, the woods were totally untouched, and gave an amazing backdrop. All in all, cross country was quite enjoyable, although I do intend to rexpierience the joy of skilifts my next few trips into the mountains.

At the urging of my Dad I watched Al Gore's &#8216;An Inconvenient Truth' last night &#8211; my first rental from my Netflix subscription. 

Even though I consider myself a fairly informed sciency type of guy, I was still surprised to see some recent statistics on factors related to environmental warming. So surprised, in fact, I did a bit of digging on the good ol' interweb to see just how straight Al's facts are. Upon first glance it appears that they pretty well represent the truth. 

I went looking for naysayers and critisism of the movie directly, and found little substance. The biggest complaint to be made by the haters is that Al himself doesn't do enough to help the cause (besides, you know, dedicating most of his life to it), stating that he takes personal jets and has a high electricity bill. Poor Al, he can't catch a break.

The movie itself could probably use some Michael Moore style spice, as the core of the action is Gore giving a Power Point presentation. He fires the facts relentlessly, and you really do start to believe that the world is in peril (!), but then things sort of end. The ending credits remind me of Van Halen's Right Now video, through without quite as poignent text, and no pictures, basically giving some ideas for what you can do to help. This all seems quite anticlimatic however. 

On second though, maybe it's better than Gore trying to act rousing. So, final conclusion &#8211; see it; it's worth it &#8211; just dont expect a thriller.

Somehow our lunchtime conversation drifted to nuclear power today at work, so I looked up a couple figures which I thought were interesting, so I'll put them here:

 - France produces 77% of its power by nuclear energy, leading the world.
 - Following France are Lithuania, Belgium and Sweden, who are all > 50%.
 - The US is currently at 20% but it does, however, produce the largest quantity of nuclear power, nearly 100 GigaWatts. France, by comparison produces 63 GigaWatts.

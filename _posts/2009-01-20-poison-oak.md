Corey, Karen, Ian and I set off hiking along the stream bed in inland Santa Barbara which makes up the path to 7 Falls during times of the year when rain makes for a much more H2O filled experience. We figured we wanted to stay away from the exposed bluffs of the surrounding terrain, this being the sweltering month of January after all. After a time of hoping along the rocks we came to a bit of an impasse, which would likely be categorized as a place of one of the 7 Falls, had there actually been any water. I decided to see if I could make my way around it, scrambling up the wash to which I found the actual trail that sane people take when doing this hike. I climbed up for a while, finally reaching the top and decided to sit for a second on a rather prominent boulder overlooking the stream bed, below, and hoping to catch a glimpse of the others. Upon taking my seat, the mini-Nalgene that I had borrowed from Karen came tumbling out of my pocket. Excited with its freedom, the bottle bounded down the cliff as only high grade polycarbonate can. It seemed many minutes before it came to a crashing stop at the bottom. I thought briefly about leaving it, but the flash of Karen's wrath quickly changed my mind to much more practical (and live preserving) thoughts. I began the decent into the chasm below, oblivious to the now painfully obvious surrounding through which I proceeded. Only one type of Oak grows on these craggy cliffs, and it's not the wizened tree. Proudly completing my task, I ran back to find the others, gleeful at my triumph over gravity.

On the morrow, after arriving back at Venice, I knew. The bubbly, itchy, rawness had slowly crept onto my face. What I had attributed to sunburn only hours ago now made itself unmistakingly clear. The next day I suffered though a tortured day at work. Coworkers stared. Was it a bar fight? Maybe his mosh-pit tendencies were finally taking grasp of his life? No, I explained, it was the inevitable outcome of not staying on the trail.

That evening I went to the emergency room at SF General. Waiting there, watching the hours go by, I felt like I should be ringing bells, high up in the towers of Notre Dame. Finally I made it through the doors which separated me from my treatment. I immediately became the attraction of the ward. My wit, charm, medical knowledge, and all-around manner immediately put me in good favor with the residents. Maybe the ogling at the condition of my face was a contributing factor as well. With no less than three residents, a 4th year med student, and the attending all in the room, a brief shot was administered, pills handed out and I was sent on my way. Overnight the steroids interacted, my body making peace with the alien oils on my skin. Everything dissipated. It is truly marvelous medicine. I've been warned about side effects. Insomnia. Insane ranting. Bouts of creativity. Nonsense I say. Utter nonsense.

Since we set the clocks back last fall I've been taking the bus into work again, which provides me with about half-an-hour a day of reading time. I've managed to put this time to pretty good use, finishing a few books that have been on my reading list for a while. I've been reading mostly fiction lately, in contrast to last year when I went through a bit of a non-fiction kick. and also getting the chance to enjoy some great fiction. I figure I should chronicle a bit about what I got out of a particular book that I've read, since, like many things in life, the experience may be fleeting.

First was Jules Verne's classic &#8220;The Mysterious Island&#8221;. I always think of Verne as a timeless legend, but the novel dates itself very readily in the opening pages by tying itself to the American Civil War. And, in fact, the novel is preceded by other &#8216;Lost on an Island' tales such as Wlliam DeFoe's &#8220;Robinson Crusoe&#8221; by over a hundred and fifty years! Verne originally penned a draft of the story as &#8220;L'Oncle Robinson&#8221; (Uncle Robinson), although he later changed the title as well as the names and relations of the main characters. Regardless, in the century and a quarter since Verne's authorship, the story has held up well, with the adventuring spirit of the characters and down to earth pragmatism of the lead character making for a very enjoyable unfolding. I tend to think of myself as an &#8220;engineers' engineer&#8221;: having a good working knowledge of a pretty diverse set of skills that come in handy in a variety of circumstances. This practicality is carried in bucket loads by the lead engineer in the story, who has a working knowledge of everything one might ever need on a deserted island. Of course the story wouldn't be very interesting if this wasn't the case, but it's a key quality of the novel that Verne details the methods through which the settlers turn their stretch of wilderness into a tiny piece of home. It's done in such a manner that many times I began to think about, what, in our modern society, I would be able to create if I had nothing but the land to start from. Unfortunately our reliance on modern electronics and advanced material processing makes this an almost impossible task. Maybe this is why the simple thoughts of log cabins, hand sown crops and self caught food remains such a dream for many. I dont often wish for a simpler life, but it's nice to take refuge in one, it only on paper.

Next I visited the classic Si-Fi Space Frontier of Robert Heinlein for the first time in a campy tale &#8220;The Rolling Stones&#8221;, whose 1952 publication date precedes other relevant pop-culture references to the name. It's basically a wanderlust tale of a family taking a leave from their home on the moon to see other parts of the solar system. The main interest for me is just to read some of the pre-space age fiction &#8211; the stuff my father would have grown up with. It definitely retains much of what I would commonly associate with the era.

I followed this up with &#8220;The Red Badge of Courage&#8221;, a short and very easy read. This is a novelette I missed in high school, so decided to fill in the hole. I found I was more intrigued by the separate short story in the book about a particular experience of his as a war corespondent in the Spanish American War. This Hemminway-esqe non-fiction story chronicled his survival in a lifeboat after the ship he was on to Cuba was sunk by a mine. It oulines quite well how vulnerable a life-raft on the ocean can be.

At roughly the same time I began another 1000 page masterpiece by Neil Stevenson, his recent &#8220;Anathem.&#8221; In classic contorted Stevenson style, this book drifts hither and fro, with strong philosophical overtones throughout. But in the end wraps up a marvelous piece of speculative fiction, full of the level of scientific detail you would expect if you've read anything by him before. And if not, to do so would be quite recommended. I'll readily admit that it's not for everyone, but for those who can stomach the content, the reward is great.

Intersperced in the last few months I've been going through many of Mark Twain's short stories. Notably, some of the storied he wrote later in his career, such as &#8220;The Mysterious Stranger&#8221;, and &#8220;The Man Who Corrupted Hadlesburg&#8221;, which show a definite change in tone from Twain's otherwise populist comical appeal. Both of these works express quite a cynical look at life, which gives some perspective on how different Twain may have been from Mr. Longhorn Clemens. If I had to pick one of the more mainstream pieces to recommend, it would have to be &#8220;The Stolen White Elephant,&#8221; who's absolute absurdity makes for an enjoyable reading as one can find.

The only book I didn't make it through recently was Chuck Dicken's &#8220;A Tale of Two Cities.&#8221; After a somewhat interesting first-third, I found the story very stagnant, and felt no attachment to the lives of any of the characters. I cheated by reading the Wikipedia plot summary of the book, and decided that I really didn't miss much anyway.

I'm currently working on &#8220;Godel, Escher, Bach&#8221; for my hardcore reading, and &#8220;Pride and Prejudice&#8221; for my lighter bus reading; neither of which I've made it very far into, so commenting on them will have to wait a bit.

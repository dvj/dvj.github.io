My dad has been having some health issues lately. First he has sick for a good 3 weeks with cold/flu like symptoms, and now he has a very intense pain in or around his kidney. He's had kidney stones before, and although he says the pain feels different, I think that would be a good outcome out of all this. He's had a ultrasound done, which detected a fuzzy blob where fuzzy blobs don't belong. Now he's looking around for a CT scan without having to leave his kidney as payment (but preferably the problematic one if it came to that). Since he works for himself, he has no health insurance, and these things aren't cheap. I'm doing my best to incourage him to get it done now, and not put it off despite the cost. I'd gladly put out a couple grand to see this checked out rather than risk it.

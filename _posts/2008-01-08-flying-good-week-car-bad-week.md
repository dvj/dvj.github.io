2008 has thus far brought both bliss and agrevation in moving my person here and there. Things got off to a pretty good start getting from the Southern Tip of Manhattan to JFK in record time thanks to a $2 subway fare, and a well-worth it $5 for the AirTrain to bridge the gap from Jamaica Station to the terminal. This is the first time I've flown from JFK since the AirTrain has been in service, which now makes getting over to Grand Central so easy, I'll definitely consider SFO-JFK links for future travel back to Poughkepepsie instead of relying on Albany.

This also marks the first time I've flown Virgin America. Upon describing the flight to my dad, I slipped and desribed the &#8220;spacecraft as impressive.&#8221; And although &#8220;spacecraft&#8221; is a more familiar word in my NASA molded vocabulary then &#8220;airplane&#8221;, this transposition is no doubt brought upon by the welcomed change of decor inside the craft. Black leather seats and injection-molded white plastic backs reflecting the soft blue mood lighting. It honestly felt like a high end strip joint with the soft but discernible light techno in the background. (Does light-techno exist?) Integrated VGA touchscreens sported enough options to keep me busy on the entirety of the 5+ hour flight. I couldn't resist rocking out some Doom I, followed by touch screen Missle Command, then settled back into some DVRed episodes of 30 Rock and then their quite extensive collection of Classical music. Along with the biggest steak sandwich I've even seen, I was quite satiated for the duration.

I feel the need to attach a price premium to the experience, which I've derived to be about $40, round trip, for a coast-to-coast trip. Besides the decadence of the accommodations, there was a marked lack of crying babies, football teams, creepy fat dudes, and llamas. I actually managed an intelligent conversation with my seatmates, which hasn't happened in quite a few transcontinental journeys.
  
A quick BART ride back home completed one of the better public transit days I've had. However, along with the impending &#8220;Weather Event of the Century&#8221; in SF, 2008 promised doom along with it's gloom.

I had two parking tickets awaiting me the next day, along with a &#8220;HELLO, WE'RE TOWING YOUR CAR IF IT'S STILL HERE TOMORROW&#8221; sign plastered on my windshield after being parked on the road for all of 2 days. Apparently my registration expired at the end of 2007, and although the new tags were awaiting my application, the SF meter maids are on the top of their game, hitting me only 2 days into the new year. Thanks.
  
The next day, some fuckwit had apparently backed into my car at a moderately high velocity tearing my fender a new one. No note. Thanks again.
  
The bitterness continued on Friday when the 70 MPH winds closed the BART, which I didn't find out until walking into the sideways rain for a half-mile to and fro. Even my Stanford Grad Student Standard Issue PVC Raingear had trouble keeping me dry. The storm was pretty nuts. After waiting half and hour for a non-existent bus, I finally got a ride in from a friend who happened to be passing by. I later discovered that the weatherproofing seal on my trunk is no longer quite up to par, and the truck is convieniently storing a couple gallons of water. Time to upgrade to a car made this century? Maybe.

The consolation is knowing that this weekend will have 6&#8242; of new snow to shoe through on Saturday with some skiing on Sunday. This post has been brought to you by a slow week at 3VR.

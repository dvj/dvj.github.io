A couple years ago when I was home over Christmas, I went through a bunch of my Dad's old slides and found a few gems. I wanted to digitize them so they had some chance at a fate other than slowly disintegrating and getting covered with basement mildew. Since I didn't have a slide scanner easily accessable, I put together a little dark-box to illuminate them and captured with my D70. This worked remarkably well &#8211; the slides have lots of detail and pretty nice colors. They sat around on my disk for a while, but now that I finally bought a copy of Lightroom, I decided to take on the task of cleaning then up and getting them online, so I spent a few hours this weekend doing just that.

Looking over the photos, it's little wonder how I acquired my love of the outdoors. Many of the photos I went through were of my parents and I out hiking in the mountains flanking the Hudson valley. So, click onwards for some incredibly cute pictures of me growing up. And Tambo. And maybe one or two of my parents too ðŸ™‚

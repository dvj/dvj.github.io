One of California's greatest qualities is that of the selective Winter. If I decided to stay in SF the whole time I'd not once be exposed to snow, or tempertures under 50 for that matter. However, when the urge strikes, the 100&#8243; snowpack is only four hours away.

On Sunday I went to Yosemite to do some snowshoeing around Dewey Point, in the South side of the park. Yosemite was predicably empty and beautiful. Brendan and I got up at 4am (!) and set out once a couple of his coworkers arrived. Our journey was slightly delayed by a speeding ticket, which turned into quite the little ordeal when Brendan had nothing to show other than his Irish drivers license. Thumb-prints, photographs and 30 miutes later, we got back on the road and were setting off to the trail by 9:30.
  
The snow was in perfect snowball packing form, with the temps in the 50s. The ~8 mile loop took us most of the day and featured some very nice scenery along the way.
  
We got back to SF at 10pm tired, sore, and perfectly content.

FInally got a date for my Singapore trip: Sept 22. I met with Kris while he was here in NY for a few days for work and put together the final plan for heading clear across the world. I'll be living on him boat for the next few months, currently docked at the South end of the island. Kris will be splitting his time between the boat and his girlfriends place. I dont really know what to expect yet of the whole Singapore experience, but hopefully it will five me a chance to do some work on my independent projects and to do some brainstorming with Kris and maybe Venzke. I've found trying to work at home to be a bit challenging. Its hard to get several hours of uninterrupted working time in a distraction free environment. Hopefully I'll be able to find a decent place to setup shop in Singapore. Just a little room with a desk and internet access. Mainly just internet access. I'm typing this on the place to SF after trying to get some work done on an iPhone app, and the lack of (free) internet really makes getting anything done pretty hard. 

I hung out with Oscar in the city last night and he's still pretty excited to come down and visit me in Singapore sometime in October or November. Now we just gotta get Haggart on board. I think Kris is planning on having his parents down sometime in November as well &#8211; we'll have to see how crowded the conditions get!

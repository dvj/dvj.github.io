Finally got around to doing the Skyline to the Sea trail on the Peninsula over President's Day weekend. Quite an enjoyable trip, although becasue it's still on the Peninsula, you never get that feeling of vast openness or the tranquility of the more sparse trails in the Sierras.

The trail starts at the Skyline Blvd enterance of Castle Rock State Park, winds along Highway 9 and 236 and enters Big Basin, passing by the H.Q., and finally meandering down to the Pacific at Waddell Beach. The short side trip past Golden, silver, and Berry falls is definitely worth it.

Although I did this as a group with some folk from the Stanford Outing Club, this would make an excellent solo trip &#8211; close to society, potable water available and trash cans (!) at the campsites. Makes life almost too easy.

* * *Got some new equipment for my camera. First, a proper flash unit &#8211; Nikon's SB-600. It's amazing how much better the quality of light from a bounce flash is over the built-in unit on my D70. Everything just looks fantastic. I probably took 200 photos of random stuff around my house the first week.</p> 

Secondly, I picked up a VR lens. It reaches 55-200mm and reduces camera shake with litlle itty bitty motors in the lens. The result &#8211; taking 1/3 of a second photos at 55mm with perfect sharpness. Amazing.

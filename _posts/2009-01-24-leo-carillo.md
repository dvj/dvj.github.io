Last weekend while down in the Greater Los Angeles Area, I stopped off at Leo Carillo Beach with Corey and Ian. Although the landscape of craggy rocks was just as I had remembered, none of the wildlife was. There was nary a starfish, no brightly colored urchins, and no funny little amenities to poke. This is quite distinct from my visit there four years ago (almost to the day!).   I got there just after low tide, with plenty of the habitable rocks exposed, but instead of fresh sand and bustling hermit crabs all I saw was swarms of sand flies and smelly seaweed. My question to you, dear reader, is where did everything go?

**Addendum 1/26/09:** I was totally wrong and didn't even know it until today. Life abounds! While I was off wandering The Wrong Way©, Corey and Ian were wandering The Right Way©, and came upon [all sorts](http://flickr.com/photos/9439733@N02/3227727214/) of  [wonderful stuff](http://flickr.com/photos/9439733@N02/3226869619/). I'll get you next time Starfish, next time!

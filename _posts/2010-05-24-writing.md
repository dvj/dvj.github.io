I don't write a lot on here because generally I feel that I have nothing entirely exhilarating to write about. But I've realized that I'll read just about anything. I'll find a random blog and just read it. The whole thing sometimes. And usually the subject matter isn't all that interesting, but when the prose is really good I'll suddenly come to the realization that I've been reading nothing for an hour and enjoying every second of it. It's like the Seinfeld of reading. So I came to the realization that I don't need an event driven blog, but a prose driven blog. This still presents a problem, that being my writing isn't entirely enthralling either, but there's only one solution for that problem, and you, dear unlucky reader, are experiencing it. Writing improves by writing. That's my noun/verb duality of the day.
